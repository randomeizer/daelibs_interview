# daelibs-frontend

This is the frontend for the daelibs interview project.

It is built with Vue 3.

There is just a single page, which displays the ScoreList component. This component is a table that displays the scores of the users. The scores are fetched from the backend, which is just hard-coded
in this example.

## Project setup

```shell
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```shell
npm run serve
```

Once the server is running, you can access the frontend at `http://localhost:8080/`.
